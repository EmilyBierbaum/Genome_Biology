# Genome Biology 
## Fall 2024 Genome Biology seminar

#### My name is Emily Bierbaum, and I am a 5th year PhD student in Dr. Bonett's lab studying the impact of life cycles on salamanders. Check out the lab website below:

## This is the home for all of my work for my favorite class!
### Day One
#### We dived into genome and sequencing basics. The scripts are below: 
- [sbatch file](https://github.com/EmilyBierbaum/Genome_Biology/blob/main/test.sbatch)
- [sh file](https://github.com/EmilyBierbaum/Genome_Biology/blob/main/test.sh)


### Genomic Adventure Time
#### We learned more about uploading and managing files on the super computer and activated the class environment via the notorious MAMBA.
#### Task One evaluated the quality of Illumina data 
- [e.coli fastqc sh](https://github.com/EmilyBierbaum/Genome_Biology/blob/main/ecoli_fastqc.sh)  
- [e.coli sbatch file](https://github.com/EmilyBierbaum/Genome_Biology/blob/main/ecoli_fastqc.sbatch)  
- [Read_1_fastqc_output](read_1_fastqc.html)   
- [Read_2_fastqc_output](read_2_fastqc.html)   

#### Task Two was for sequence data quality control and adaptor trimming
- [e.coli trim sbatch](ecoli_trim.sbatch) 
- [e.coli sh](ecoli_trim.sh) 

#### Task Three conducted random sub-sampling and digital normalization
- No script or sbatch files 
#### Task Four aligned Illumina data to a reference sequence 
- No script ot sbatch files 

#### Task Five generates an index 
- [e.coli index sbatch](ecoli_trim.sbatch) 
- [e.coli index sh](ecoli_index.sh)  

#### Task Six maps reads to the indexed reference sequence
 - [e.coli bwa mem sbatch](ecoli_bwa_mem.sbatch)
 - [ecoli bwa mem sh](ecoli_bwa_mem.sh) 

#### Task Seven manipulates SAM file

#### Task Eight removes PCR duplicates

#### Task Nine maps statistics

#### Task Ten QualiMap

#### Task 11 gives a graphical view of the alignments 

#### Task 12 evaluates SNPs and indels

#### Task 13 identifies SNPs and indels manually

#### Task 14 automates analyses

#### Task 15 locates genes that are missing compared to the reference
