## This is the home for all of my work for my favorite class!
### Day One
#### We dived into genome and sequencing basics. The scripts are below: 
- [sbatch file](https://github.com/EmilyBierbaum/Genome_Biology/blob/main/test.sbatch)
- [sh file](https://github.com/EmilyBierbaum/Genome_Biology/blob/main/test.sh)


### Day Two
#### We learned more about uploading and managing files on the super computer and activated the class environment via the notorious MAMBA.
